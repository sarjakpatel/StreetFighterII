# StreetFighterII

<b>Project Outline:</b>
Street Fighter is a video gaming series (a fighting game). 
Fighting games are unique compared to other game types because it needs a fast reaction and contains lots of uncertainty on your opponentâ€™s moves. 
In video games, various artificial intelligence techniques have been used in a variety of ways, ranging from non-player character control to procedural content generation. . 
Street Fighter AI will play against human players to defeat them.
We have used Street Fighter 2 for training environment and implemented it with Python. 

<b>Methodology:</b>
- Setting up Street Fighter
- Preprocessing
- Hyperparameter Tuning 
- Fine Tuning the Model
- Testing the Model
